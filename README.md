# reactCount


## Overview

Welcome to the React Counter App! This is a simple yet functional React application that serves as a basic example of state management within a React component. The app allows users to interact with a counter, offering features like incrementing, decrementing (with a restriction to prevent going below 0), and resetting to 0.

## Features

- **Increment Counter:** Increase the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement Counter:** Decrease the counter value by 1 (restricted to prevent going below 0).
- **Reset Counter:** Set the counter back to 0.

## Technologies Used

The application is built using the following technologies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework for responsive and visually appealing web design.

Components
The main component driving the functionality of the app is CounterND.js, located in the src directory. It encapsulates the following key features:

increment: Increases the counter value by 1.
decrement: Decreases the counter value by 1 (with a restriction to prevent going below 0).
refresh: Resets the counter to 0.
Styling
The application leverages Bootstrap for styling. The styles are defined in the Counter.css file, providing a clean and modern appearance to the counter app.

Notes
The counter is safeguarded against going below 0 to prevent negative values.
An error message is displayed if attempting to decrement below 0.
